Data Connector
Hi, 

Welcome to "Connector.Com", one of the new, 'Tech Startups', with revenues in the Billions.

And congratulations on obtaining the positions of 'Systems Administrator' and 'Cybersecurity Analyst'.

Due to the nature of the 'Data and Software Assets', it has been decided that to gain access to our networks, you must complete a 'Second Factor Authentication'.

We have decided to 'Gamify', the process, just to maintain interest and also at the same time, build on your skills, in Network and Computer Engineering, being a first-year apprentice, within this challenging role.

Once you complete the simple puzzle, as listed within the game's instructions.

You will then be able to access your 'Shared Drives', upon on 'Local Servers'.

Please note this test is randomly generated, mostly by an 'Artificial Intelligence (AI)', and has not been fully tested for its application of the game's logic.

We are working quickly on this and are analysing your attempts at the puzzle, with the hope we can build a better version soon, with more elements and tougher puzzles and perhaps even a 'Timer', to speed along your accuracy and analysis skills, we will present some statistics each month upon whom has achieved the most successful logins, in one month. We do understand that the data will be slightly skewed by the employees, required logins in a day and any extras they do. So, we will be moderating against these criteria and hope it will result in a fair and balanced, means to maintain our security, improve your skills and genuinely have some fun whilst doing so.

Yours Faithfully
